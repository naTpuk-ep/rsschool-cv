I have been learning JavaScript for the last 8 months. Also I'm trying React and I want to learn React Native for cross-platform development of frontend functionality.

I've got some skills of basics HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, OOP, git during my self-education by free courses, solving problems on codewars.com and books (learn.javascript.ru, developer.mozilla.org and others).

You can see examples of my code on my github account: github.com/naTpuk-ep.

I graduated from BSUIR in 2013 with a degree in radio-electronics, worked in the concert field as a sound engineer and I have a rather engineering mindset, I guess).

I think my English level is A2. I studied English at school and university. I can read in English, understand clear English speech, but i have small problem with my speech becouse of lack of daily experience with native speakers, I have some practice on my concert work, so it won't be a big problem for me in future, I just need a little practice.
